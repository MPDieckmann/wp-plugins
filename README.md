## Frequently Asked Questions

### What marks a valid csv-file as `crossword puzzle optimized`?

A `crossword puzzle optimized csv-file` will look like following:
In the first row in first cell you have to write the keyword `crossword`; each other cell in this row must stay empty.
The following rows must be filled up with single letters, `questionIndex#arrow`-marks or must stay empty.
After you have finished filling up the crossword you have to write in the row directly under the crossword in the first cell: `questions`; each other cell in this row must stay empty.
After this row you have to write the questions in following format:
* first cell in row: `questionIndex`
* second cell in row: Your question
* each following cell in row must stay empty

### What will a `questionIndex#arrow`-mark look like?

This mark can be splitted up in 3 parts:

1. the `questionIndex`-part: a positive integer starting at 0
1. the `#`-part: to seperate part 1 and 3
1. the `arrow`-part: one of the following snippets:
  * `up`: will display an up-pointing arrow
  * `down`: will display a down-pointing arrow
  * `left`: will display a left-pointing arrow
  * `right`: will display a right-pointing arrow
